# Express Portfolio
### *a portfolio example made with Express*
-

This project makes use of both express and bootstrap.

The basic functionalities are all present: server-ejs with all the links, all the pages needed including the 404 page for non-existent pages.

It is fully scalable on all devices.

-

Difficulties:

- Remember all the passages of the procedure to implement express.
- Having a repetitive framework with all the projects so I don't need to repeat all the elements and just send the new information such as the image and the description.
